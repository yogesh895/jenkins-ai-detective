## Jenkins AI Detective


The Jenkins AI Detective is a proof-of-concept web application designed to help diagnose build failures in Jenkins CI/CD pipelines. It uses data from ci.jenkins.io to categorize failures and provide intelligent analysis.

## Main Sections

### 1. Dashboard (Home Page)

The dashboard serves as the landing page and provides a high-level overview of the system:

-   **Hero Section**: Introduces the application's purpose with a visually appealing gradient background and call-to-action buttons.
    
-   **Overview Cards**: Three main cards showing the breakdown of failure types:
    
    -   **Infrastructure Issues (42%)**: Problems related to build agents, network connectivity, or Jenkins configuration.
    -   **Code Issues (27%)**: Legitimate failures due to actual bugs or incompatibilities in the code.
    -   **Flaky Tests (31%)**: Tests that pass and fail inconsistently without code changes.
-   **Recent Failures Table**: Displays the latest build failures with their type, status, and an option to analyze them in detail.
    
-   **How It Works**: Explains the process behind the AI Detective:
    
    1.  Data Analysis: Processing ci.jenkins.io data with machine learning
    2.  LLM Fine-tuning: Enhancing the model with Jenkins-specific knowledge
    3.  AI Diagnosis: Intelligent analysis of build failures
-   **Get Started**: Provides example questions to ask the AI and a button to start chatting.
    

### 2. Repositories Tab

The Repositories tab shows information about specific Jenkins repositories:

-   **Repository Cards**: Each card represents a monitored Jenkins repository with:
    -   Failure rate and trend (improving, declining, stable)
    -   Breakdown of failure types (infrastructure, code, flaky tests)
    -   Build count and last build time
    -   Buttons for analytics and AI chat specific to that repository

### 3. Trends Tab

The Trends tab visualizes patterns over time:

-   **Line Chart**: Shows the trajectory of different failure types over weeks
-   **Key Insights**: Presents important observations about trends
-   **Recommendations**: Provides short, medium, and long-term suggestions based on the data
-   **Actions**: Quick buttons to ask the AI for recommendations, explore analytics, or generate reports

### 4. Analytics Page

This page offers more detailed data analysis:

-   **Trends**: Visualizes failure patterns over time with a line chart
-   **Repositories**: Compares failure rates across different repositories
-   **Failure Types**: Shows the distribution of failure categories with a pie chart
-   **Comparisons**: Provides side-by-side analysis of failure patterns across repositories

### 5. Chat Page (AI Interaction)

This is where users can interact directly with the AI:

-   **Chat Interface**: A conversational UI for asking questions about Jenkins build failures
-   **Build Selector**: Allows users to select a specific build to analyze
-   **Example Questions**: Suggestions for what to ask the AI
-   **Response Area**: Where the AI's answers appear, potentially with charts and visualizations

## Significance of UI Elements

1.  **Color Coding**:
    
    -   Blue for infrastructure issues
    -   Green for code issues
    -   Yellow for flaky tests This consistent color scheme makes it easy to identify failure types across the application.
2.  **Charts and Visualizations**: Help users understand complex data patterns at a glance, making trends more apparent.
    
3.  **Interactive Elements**: Buttons, tabs, and cards that respond to user interaction, creating an engaging experience.
    
4.  **Clear Navigation**: The tabbed interface and navigation links help users move between different views of the data.
    
5.  **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability across devices.
    
6.  **Information Hierarchy**: Most important information is presented prominently, with details available through progressive disclosure.
    
7.  **Call-to-Action Buttons**: Guide users toward key functionality like starting a chat or viewing analytics.
    

## Business Value

This application provides significant value by:

1.  **Reducing Troubleshooting Time**: Quickly identifying the cause of build failures saves developer time.
    
2.  **Improving Build Reliability**: Understanding patterns helps teams address root causes.
    
3.  **Knowledge Sharing**: Centralizing insights about common failures helps spread knowledge across teams.
    
4.  **Data-Driven Decisions**: Metrics and trends help teams prioritize infrastructure or test improvements.
    

The Jenkins AI Detective represents a modern approach to CI/CD troubleshooting, leveraging machine learning to make sense of the vast amount of build data generated in Jenkins environments.
